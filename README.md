# 🌍 Global Diabetes Analysis

An in-depth analysis of global diabetes prevalence trends using real-world data from [NCD-RisC](http://ncdrisc.org/). This project provides insights into diabetes statistics across various countries, age groups, and time periods, accompanied by engaging visualizations.

---

## 🎯 **Goal of the Analysis**
The primary aim of this analysis is to:
- Identify trends in global diabetes prevalence.
- Highlight age-specific and country-specific diabetes data.
- Present actionable insights for understanding and combating diabetes.

---

## 🛠️ **How It Works**
1. **Data Collection**:  
   The dataset used in this project is sourced from [NCD-RisC](http://ncdrisc.org/), a globally recognized organization for chronic disease risk factor collaboration.

2. **Data Processing**:  
   - Cleaned and structured the dataset for effective analysis.
   - Processed data using **Python** libraries such as `pandas` and `matplotlib`.

3. **Analysis & Visualization**:  
   - Explored diabetes prevalence by **age groups**, **countries**, and **global trends**.
   - Generated visualizations to make the findings more comprehensible.

4. **Results**:  
   - Detailed insights and visual results are included in the `Results/` folder for further exploration.
